## Hi ðŸ‘‹
Focus on backend development, but obviously I like programming in general. Recently I am learning Python and Data Analytics. Be welcome to collaborate in my repositories and talk to me for work in some project or organization.

Tools that I use actually: Power BI, Python, MySQL Workbrench, MongoDB, Git and Articial Intelligence.
