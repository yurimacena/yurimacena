## Hello, mate! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
I'm currently learning Java and SQL. I'm want to become a backend developer and I have knowledge in Python, Artificial Intelligence, Power BI and Git. Be welcome to talk with me in Telegram for working together in some project. By the way, I'm also testing Linux distros. Recently using Ubuntu Unity.
