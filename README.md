## Hi ðŸ‘‹
Focus on backend development, but obviously I like programming in general. Recently I am learning Python and Artificial Intelligence, but I have some interest in low-level languages, especially Rust and Assembly. Be welcome to collaborate in my repositories and talk to me for work in some project or organization.
